Book Store API

This project aims to build a RESTful API for managing an online bookstore. This project is implemented using the Django REST Framework and will enable users to interact with the bookstore's database to perform various operations, such as retrieving book information, adding new books, managing authors, genres, and publishers, and filtering books based on different criteria.
